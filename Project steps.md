# Library Management System Project Outline:

## 1. Define Requirements:
   - Users should be able to add new books with details such as title, author, ISBN, and quantity available.
   - Implement a borrowing system where users can check out books.
   - Allow users to return books, updating the quantity available.
   - Display a list of all books in the library.
   - Provide a search functionality to find books by title, author, or ISBN.

## 2. Design the Data Structures:
   - Create structures or classes to represent books and users.
   - Think about how you'll store the library data, such as using arrays, linked lists, or dynamic memory allocation.

## 3. Implement CRUD Operations:
   - Implement functions to Add, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) books in the library.
   - Ensure that the borrowing and returning of books are handled correctly.

## 4. User Interface:
   - Create a simple text-based menu system for users to interact with the library.
   - Display options for adding, borrowing, returning, and searching for books.

## 5. File I/O:
   - Implement file I/O operations to save the library data to a file so that it can be loaded and reused between program runs.

## 6. Error Handling:
   - Include proper error handling to deal with situations like attempting to borrow more books than are available or trying to return a book that hasn't been borrowed.

## 7. Testing:
   - Test your program thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
   - Include edge cases in your testing to make sure your program handles all scenarios.

## 8. Documentation:
   - Write documentation for your code, explaining the purpose of each function and how to use your program.

## 9. Optional Enhancements:
   - Implement a user authentication system if you want to track which user borrowed each book.
   - Add a due date for borrowed books and implement a system to notify users when their books are overdue.

## 10. Polish and Refine:
   - Review your code for any improvements or optimizations.
   - Make your user interface more user-friendly if possible.


Remember to break down the tasks into smaller steps and tackle them one at a time. This approach will make it easier to manage and troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development. Good luck with your Library Management System project!
